# Basic building blocks in JavaScript

Now lets see how can we do complex application with our variables and types

## Building blocks

There are 3 building blocks in programming science which can be used to build
any kind of application. One you know already, the assignment

```js
let variable = 12; // this is an assignment
```

Next you will get familiar with the other 2.

### Condition

You can make a piece of your code optional, with the `if` statement. It let you
define a condition which your code depends on

```js
let myVariable = false;
if (myVariable === true) {
  console.log('Hello World!');
}
```

If you run the above code in the console or ina webpage you will see nothing in
the console. Please change something to see the desired message in the console.

Our `if` statement gives us more capabilities, we can tell what we want to
execute if the given condition has been evaluated to false.

```js
let a = 7;
if (a < 5) {
  console.log(a * 2);
} else {
  console.log(a * 3);
}
```

Questions:

- What will be printed if we run the previous code snippet?
- What should is change to get 1 printed to the console?

You can read more about the `if` statement in the [documentation][mdn-if]

### Loops

Sometimes you want to execute a piece of code several times. Like in the real
life when you want to move books from one shelf to another.

- you grab the book
- you move it to the other shelf
- you release the book

And you do this until you have books to move.

```js
let bookCount = 10;

for (let i = 0; i < bookCount; i++) {
  // here comes the code which moves to books
  // this block will be repeated bookCunt times
}
```

#### Exercise 1

Create a loop which prints the numbers from 0-9.

#### Exercise 2

Change the previous loop to print the numbers from 1 to 10.

#### Exercise 3

Print the even numbers between 0 and 20.

## Functions

Usually there are many repeating code blocks in an application, when we want
to execute the same code but with different circumstances/environments. Just
imagine how you pay your bills. The steps are the same you just transfer the
money to a different bank account ans different money. So the money and the bank
account are parameters of this activity. In programming languages these
activities are called functions.

```js
let payBill = (amount, beneficiary) => {
  // transfer amount money to the beneficiary
};
```

Within functions you can use the `return` keyword which will give back the
function's output. For example if you want to add 2 numbers, then you will need
the result as well:

```js
let add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;  // the return keyword will give you back the result
};

console.log(add(1, 2)) // will print 3
```

### Exercise 1

Use your previous for loops and create a function which print the first **N**
numbers.

```js
printNumbersTill(20); // should print 1, 1, 2, ...., 20
printNumbersTill(15); // should print 1, 1, 2, ...., 15
```

### Exercise 2

Create a method which gets a name as parameter and then returns a greeting to
the specified person.

```js
getGreetingTo('Mark');              // Should not print to the console
console.log(getGreetingTo('Mark')); // Should print 'Hello Mark!'
```

## For loops and arrays

We need to iterate through array pretty often, what do you think how can you do
that? As you remember for loops execute something **N** times, so if we want to
print an array's values we will need to execute the loop `.length` times.

### Exercise 1

Create a method which get an array as parameter and prints each value in it.

```js
printValues([0, 3, 6, 7, 9]); // prints the following lines:
//  0
//  3
//  6
//  7
//  9
```

This is how you solution should look like:

```js
let printValues = (array) => {
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    console.log(array[i]);
  }
};
```

### `forEach`

Usually we try to avoid this `i` variable, it makes our code more complicated.
When we want to iterate through an array we have a special syntax for that.

```js
let myNumbers = [10, 20, 30, 50, 12];

// here we say, we want to do something with each item
myNumbers.forEach((number) => {
  // within the function I can define what I want to do with the items
  console.log(number);
});
```

#### Exercise 2

Change your previous `printValues` function to use `forEach` loop.
