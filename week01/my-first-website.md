- Your task is to recreate this [website](https://projects.invisionapp.com/share/X575YEGVU#/screens/155416515_Greenfox-Anakins-Cv).
- Try to make it as similar as possible to the design above.

##Â Steps

- **Create a new Pen.**

- **Start with the content.** Copy-paste the text content from [here](assets/cv.md) to start with.
- **Give it some structure.** What semantic role do these paragraphs fill?
  Divide it into a few separate HTML tags. Look up what the `<blockquote>`,
  `<q>`, `<hgroup>`, `<nav>` elements are for, use them.
- **Add a header image.** Choose a picture of your taste from here.

- Now you can paste the code in your css file.
- Don't forget to set the height and width property of the image.
- To make the header more readable, set the [opacity](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/opacity) of the image.
---

- **Add in style.** Create a style.css file and link it to your HTML. Start with
  basic text styles, like size, color, margins, line-height. How do you center
  content on the page? Try adding a custom font via
  [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) based on the comments on the
  design.
